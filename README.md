# ProfessionalProfile
The Professional Profile App is a comprehensive WPF application developed as part of a university course project. The application allows users to manage their professional profiles, including sections for Education, Work Experience, Certifications, Skills, and Volunteering.

## Development
This project was developed collaboratively by a team of students, with my contributions in the following areas:
- Education Section: Adding and editing educational qualifications.
- Work Experience Section: Managing past and current job roles and responsibilities.
- Certifications Section: Recording professional certifications and credentials.
- Skills Section: Listing technical and soft skills.
- Volunteering Section: Documenting volunteer work and community involvement.
